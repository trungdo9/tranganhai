# Kit Builder

> Create custom skills, agents, and workflows to extend ClaudeKit Marketing for your specific needs.

---

## What This Skill Does

**Challenge**: Every marketing team has unique processes and tools. The built-in skills in ClaudeKit Marketing are great for common use cases but may not cover the specifics of each business.

**Solution**: The kit-builder skill provides a framework to create custom skills, agents, and workflows — from simple slash commands to complex multi-agent pipelines — and integrate them into ClaudeKit Marketing.

---

## Activation

**Implicit**: Activates automatically when a new skill needs to be built or extended.

**Explicit**: Activate via prompt:
```
Activate kit-builder skill to create [skill/agent/workflow] for [purpose]
```
