/**
 * branch-guard.cjs — PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash). Refuses a git command
 * that would move HEAD while another live session shares the working tree.
 *
 * WHY A HOOK. The verdict already existed in `scripts/ck/branch-guard.cjs` and
 * was registered nowhere: `.claude/settings.json` listed `scout-block` and
 * `guard-destructive` only, and the sole instruction to use it was one line of
 * prose in `.claude/commands/ck/git.md` ("Before running one, check it"). So the
 * gate fired exactly when the model chose to run it — which is not a gate, and
 * `guard-destructive`'s own suite asserts `git checkout -b feat/x` is benign, so
 * nothing else stopped it either. A shared HEAD is a mechanical invariant; it
 * needs a mechanical check.
 *
 * FAILS OPEN, deliberately and in three ways: an unparseable payload, a missing
 * checks module (the marketing kit ships `.claude/` without `scripts/ck/`), and
 * an unreadable claim registry all exit 0. This hook adds a refusal to a
 * previously-allowed action, so a bug in it must not become a new way for work
 * to fail. The refusal is narrow and the override is documented in the message.
 *
 * Exit: 0 = allow · 2 = deny (reason on stderr, shown to the model)

/**
 * Where `scripts/ck/` sits relative to this hook. Current installs keep it at
 * `.claude/scripts/ck/`; the root `scripts/ck/` is where it lived up to 1.5.1
 * and is still tried, because a no-`--force` upgrade refreshes the two trees on
 * different runs and a hook that resolves nothing is a gate that silently stops
 * existing. `ck init` deletes the legacy copy only on a digest match, so when
 * this fallback hits, the file it loads is one ClauKit shipped.
