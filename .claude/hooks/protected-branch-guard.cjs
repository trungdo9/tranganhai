/**
 * protected-branch-guard.js — PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash). Refuses a git
 * command that would publish to a long-lived shared branch.
 *
 * WHY A HOOK, AND WHY THIS ONE DID NOT EXIST. Two separate sessions had a
 * delegated agent push to `staging` against an explicit instruction not to; one
 * pushed six commits and the code had already been pulled, so there was nothing
 * to revert. An audit of both kits afterwards found the reason: **no hook
 * anywhere refused a push.** `guard-destructive` denies `push --force` without a
 * lease and nothing else; `branch-guard` classifies `checkout` / `switch` /
 * `branch` only — its `MOVES_HEAD` set is `{create, switch, detach}`, so `push`
 * and `merge` never reach it. The whole defence was one line of prose in
 * `agents/git-manager.md` ("Only push if user explicitly requested"), and that
 * line was read and ignored twice. A shared branch is a mechanical invariant.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES (each verified in scripts/verify-protected-branch-guard.js):
 *   1. An explicit protected destination — `git push origin staging`,
 *      `HEAD:staging`, `+staging`, `feature:refs/heads/main`.
 *   2. A DELETE of one — `git push --delete origin staging`, `git push origin :main`.
 *   3. An implicit one — bare `git push`, `git push origin`, `git push -u origin`
 *      or `git push origin HEAD` **while HEAD is standing on a protected
 *      branch**. This is the shape both real incidents took: nobody types the
 *      branch name, the agent is simply already on it.
 *   4. `--all` / `--mirror`, which carry every branch including the protected ones.
 *   5. `git merge <anything>` while HEAD is on a protected branch — the local
 *      half of "merged staging and pushed six commits".
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY ALLOWS, because a guard that fires on these gets routed
 * around within a day:
 *   - `git merge origin/staging` from a feature branch. `rules/branching-rules.md`
 *     §3 Stage 1 instructs exactly that before opening a PR. Only the direction
 *     matters: what is refused is merging *while standing on* the shared branch.
 *   - `git push origin v1.4.0` and `--tags`. §3 Stage 3 tags releases this way;
 *     a tag ref is not a branch, and `refs/tags/...` is matched explicitly.
 *   - `git push --dry-run` — it writes nothing, and it is how you check a refspec.
 *   - `git rebase staging` / `git fetch` / `git pull` — none publishes anything.
 *
 * CONSENT is `CK_ALLOW_PROTECTED_PUSH=1`, either exported for the run or as an
 * assignment prefix on the one command (`CK_ALLOW_PROTECTED_PUSH=1 git push ...`),
 * which consents to that segment alone. Same mechanism as
 * `CK_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE` / `CK_AUTO_MODE`, for the same reason: a `--flag` on a
 * slash command never reaches a hook, an env var does.
 *
 * `CK_AUTO_MODE=1` does NOT bypass this, on purpose. Auto mode consents to
 * moving a shared HEAD — a local, recoverable act. Publishing to `staging` is
 * neither, and an unattended run is precisely the context both incidents
 * happened in.
 *
 * FAILS OPEN on: an unreadable payload, a segment it cannot tokenize, and a
 * current branch it cannot resolve (not a repo => the push would fail anyway).
 * This hook adds a refusal to a previously-allowed action, so a bug in it must
 * not become a new way for work to fail.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE: this file is shipped by BOTH kits — norskmat-claude-skills
 * (`.claude/hooks/protected-branch-guard.js`) and ClauKit
 * (`.claude/hooks/protected-branch-guard.cjs`) — and the two copies are
 * **byte-identical**; only the extension differs, which is each kit's own module
 * convention. A repo receives exactly one of them, never both.
 *
 * Keeping them identical needed one design choice: the two kits have different
 * doc trees (ClauKit ships no `rules/`), so the ladder pointer in the refusal is
 * RESOLVED AT RUNTIME from whichever doc the receiving project actually has —
 * see LADDER_DOCS. Hard-coding it would have been the one line that differed,
 * and a one-line difference is how two copies start drifting.
 *
 * Exit: 0 = allow · 2 = deny (reason on stderr, shown to the model)

 * production branch outright.
 *
 * THE LIST IS NOT CONFIGURABLE, deliberately — `CK_PROTECTED_BRANCHES` was removed on
 * 2026-09-06. It used to override this set, and an EMPTY value disabled the list
 * outright: a guard any caller could switch off by exporting one empty string, in the
 * same estate that had already seen two sessions publish to a shared branch unasked.
 * An off switch is a guard's weakest point, not its flexibility. Extending the set for
 * one repo now means editing this constant here, which is a reviewed change instead of
 * an inline one.
 *
 * The cost, stated rather than hidden: a repo whose long-lived integration branch is not
 * named below can no longer protect it through configuration. That is the accepted price
 * of removing the off switch — the alternative kept a bypass available to everything.
