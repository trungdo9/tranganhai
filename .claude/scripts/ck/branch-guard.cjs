/**
 * branch-guard.cjs — refuse to move HEAD while another live session shares the
 * tree (CLI). Checks and rationale live in `lib/branch-checks.cjs`.
 *
 * Usage: node .claude/scripts/ck/branch-guard.cjs "<git command>" [--auto]
 * Exit:  0 = ALLOW · 1 = DENY (reason on stderr) · 2 = usage
 *
 * This is the ASK-FIRST path, for a command a pipeline is about to run. The
 * mechanical one is `.claude/hooks/branch-guard.cjs`, a PreToolUse hook that
 * requires this file and applies the same verdict to every Bash call — prose in
 * a command doc ("before running one, check it") is not enforcement, and for one
 * release this guard existed with no registration anywhere.
 *
 * CONSENT. `/ck:cook --auto` and the other `--auto` pipelines may branch per
 * feature — the flag is the operator's consent, given at invocation. A slash
 * command's flags are invisible to a PreToolUse hook, so consent travels the way
 * `guard-destructive` already does it: `CK_AUTO_MODE=1`, as an env var for the run
 * or as a prefix on the one command (prefix binds to that segment only).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT derived from the run ledger: a `--auto` line in a plan's
 * STATE.md is durable, and a durable marker makes consent sticky — a later
 * interactive session in the same plan dir would inherit permission it was never
 * given. Per-command consent cannot go stale.

 * A registry that cannot be read yields an empty set — this guard adds a
 * refusal, so it must never become a new way for work to fail.
 *
 * The registry is resolved against the REPO ROOT, not the cwd. Spawning
 * `.claude/hooks/file-claims.cjs` as a cwd-relative path meant that from any
 * subdirectory the spawn failed, the catch below returned an empty set, and
 * every HEAD move was allowed with the note "no other live session holds a
 * claim" — a fail-open that reads as a verdict. `list` itself resolves the
 * worktree from its cwd, so it is given the root too.
