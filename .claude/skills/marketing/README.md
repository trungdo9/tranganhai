## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install marketing kit
ck init --kit marketing

# 2. Setup hub context (one-time, required)
#    Activates: /mk:plan → product-marketing skill
#    Output: plans/marketing-context.md (ICP, positioning, brand voice)
mk:plan

# 3. Run a full campaign
mk:campaign <campaign-name>
```

**Hard-fail rule:** Every `/mk:` command requires `plans/marketing-context.md`. If absent, you'll be directed to run `/mk:plan` first. See `.claude/workflows/marketing-rules.md`.

## Commands

## Workflows

All in `.claude/workflows/`:

### 1. `marketing-workflow.md` — 10 phases (end-to-end campaign)

```
Phase 0: Setup (one-time) → marketing-context.md
  ↓
Phase 1: Research ─┐
                   ├→ Phase 2: Insights → Phase 3: Strategy
Phase 1b: Trends ─┘                         ↓
                                     Phase 4: Plan
                                           ↓
                          Phase 5: Create (parallel: copy + visual + video)
                                           ↓
                          Phase 6: Edit (copy + SEO + CRO)
                                           ↓
                          Phase 7: Publish
                                           ↓
                          Phase 8: Promote (paid + influencer)
                                           ↓
                          Phase 9: Measure (GA4 + GSC)
                                           ↓
                          Phase 10: Optimize → (loop to Phase 3)
```

### 2. `seo-workflow.md` — 7 phases (closed-loop SEO campaign)

```
Phase 0: Gate → Phase 1: Baseline (audit + GSC/GA4 metrics)
   ↓
Phase 2: Plan (cluster + backlog + briefs — HARD STOP for review)
   ↓
Phase 3: Write (batch, seo-writing Stages 3–5) → Phase 4: Publish (draft-default)
   ↓
Phase 5: Distribute (optional) → Phase 6: Measure (2–4 wk bake, vs baseline)
   ↓
Phase 7: Optimize — scale / refresh / kill → (loop to Phase 3)
```

Trigger: `/mk:seo campaign <seed | wp:site>`. Wraps the `seo-writing` 6-stage pipeline with a metrics baseline + refresh loop; state shared via `pipeline.md`.

### 3. `sales-workflow.md` — 5 phases

```
Generate → Qualify → Nurture → Convert → Retain
```

### 4. `crm-workflow.md` — 5 phases

```
Calendar → Forms → Tasks → Gmail → BigQuery
```

### 5. `video-workflow.md` — 6 phases

```
Script → Voiceover → Visuals → Edit → Render → Distribute
```

### 6. `design-workflow.md` — 5 phases

```
Concept → Model → Shader → Animate → Export
```

## Claude-SEO Engine ⭐

The marketing kit uses `AgriciDaniel/claude-seo` (8.4k stars, 271 tests) as its SEO backbone. This is the production-grade SEO engine that runs **25 sub-skills in parallel** with **18 specialist agents**.

### Architecture (3-layer)

```
User → /mk:seo audit <url>           (Layer 1: Directive)
        ↓
  skills/marketing/seo/SKILL.md     (Layer 2: Orchestrator)
        ↓
  - Industry detection (SaaS, local, ecommerce, publisher, agency)
  - Parallel dispatch (up to 15 sub-skills simultaneously)
  - Synthesis via 10-principle framework (PERCEIVE → ANALYZE → VALIDATE → ACT)
        ↓
  25 sub-skills + 18 agents         (Layer 3: Execution)
        ↓
  Output: plans/<name>/seo-audit-report.md
          (each finding has a falsifiability check)
```

### Available sub-skills (25)

| Category | Sub-skills |
|---|---|
| Audit | `seo-audit`, `seo-page`, `seo-technical` |
| Content | `seo-content` (E-E-A-T), `seo-content-brief`, `seo-cluster` |
| Schema | `seo-schema` |
| Technical | `seo-sitemap`, `seo-images`, `seo-drift` |
| AI Search | `seo-geo` (Generative Engine Optimization) |
| Local | `seo-local`, `seo-maps` |
| Commerce | `seo-ecommerce`, `seo-hreflang` |
| Extensions | `seo-firecrawl`, `seo-dataforseo`, `seo-image-gen`, `seo-google`, `seo-backlinks`, `seo-sxo`, `seo-plan`, `seo-programmatic`, `seo-competitor-pages`, `seo-flow` |

### When to use claude-seo

- **Use claude-seo for:** full-site audit, technical SEO, content quality (E-E-A-T), schema validation, local SEO, AI-search optimization
- **Use custom `/mk:seo` for:** targeted quick checks, keyword research, programmatic SEO templates
- **Cross-reference:** both share `seo-schema` skill (single source of truth for JSON-LD templates)

### Key principle: Falsifiable findings

Every recommendation from claude-seo includes a **falsifiability check** — "how would we know this failed?" This makes every finding testable, not just opinion.

## SEO Writing Pipeline ⭐ (`seo-writing` + `seo-writer`)

Where claude-seo *audits*, the **`seo-writing`** pipeline *produces* — it takes a seed keyword (or an existing site) all the way to published, optimized, interlinked articles. It's the ClauKit-native port of a production n8n workflow, run as a 6-stage assembly line with a status machine so the work is inspectable, resumable, and safe at scale.

```
Stage 1  Research & Strategy      seed keyword → Pillar/Sub-Pillar/Cluster tree      → new
Stage 2  Competitor Analysis      top-3 SERP → gap-closing outline (H2/H3, FAQ)      → outline_ready
Stage 3  Content Writing          deep, one H2 at a time, then assemble             → writing_completed
Stage 4  On-Page Optimization     meta, slug, tags, density, images+alt, schema      → ready_to_publish
Stage 5  Internal Linking         weave into the cluster (up/down/sideways)          → ready_to_publish
Stage 6  Publish                  WordPress/REST, idempotent, DRAFT-default          → published
```

**Entry points:**
- `/mk:seo plan <seed|wp:site>` — Stages 1–2 only → a reviewed **write plan** (`pipeline.md` + briefs). Stops before writing burns tokens.
- `/mk:seo write [<id>|--batch N]` — run the pipeline → finished article(s), draft by default.
- The `seo-writer` agent orchestrates the whole thing (modes: `plan` / `write-one` / `write-batch` / `publish` / `full`).

**Key guarantees:**
- **Truth-only** — no placeholder entities ("Shop A"), no invented stats. Missing data → analytical form or `[NEEDS DATA]`.
- **Deep-write** — sections written one at a time (the quality lever over one-shot "write 2000 words").
- **Draft-default publishing** — live publish needs an explicit flag + confirmation; idempotent by slug (never duplicates).
- **Resumable** — state lives in `plans/marketing/<site>/pipeline.md`; any stage re-runs without redoing the rest.

**Signature use case — existing WordPress site (~100 posts, mediocre SEO):** `references/playbook-100-articles.md` walks it end-to-end — inventory + triage the existing posts (read-only), map them onto a target cluster, prioritize the gaps (improve-before-create), batch-write, publish drafts, then interlink + measure. Research plugs into Exa/DataForSEO/SerpAPI when available, falls back to WebSearch/WebFetch.

**Fills these (previously stub) sub-skills with real content:** `seo-cluster`, `seo-content-brief`, `seo-content`, `seo-plan`, `seo-images`, `seo-flow`.

## MCPs (Bring Your Own Server)

The kit includes 5 MCP skill wrappers. **You provide the MCP server** — wrappers document the tools and parameters.

| MCP | Purpose | Required env | Manual fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GA4** | Traffic reports, real-time, 200+ metrics, attribution | `GA4_PROPERTY_ID`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Export GA4 → CSV → Read tool |
| **GSC** | SEO analytics, indexing, sitemaps, keywords | `GSC_SITE_URL`, service account | Export GSC → CSV → Read tool |
| **SendGrid** | Transactional email, marketing campaigns, analytics | `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | Generate templates, manual send |
| **Resend** | Developer-first email API, React Email | `RESEND_API_KEY` | Generate React Email components |
| **ReviewWeb** | Reputation audit, review monitoring, sentiment | `REVIEWWEB_API_KEY` | Ask user to paste reviews |
| **WordPress** | Publish/update posts & pages, media, taxonomies, SEO meta, audit | `WP_SITE_URL`, `WP_USER`, `WP_APP_PASSWORD` | curl REST path (`wordpress-rest` skill) |

**Without MCP server:** Every wrapper has a **manual fallback mode** — generates templates, accepts CSV paste, or asks user to run steps manually. Kit still works.

## User cases
