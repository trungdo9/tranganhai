description: Red-green test-driven discipline — NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST. Use for bug fixes (default), regression-prone changes, or when asked to "write tests first" / "TDD this". Covers red → verify-red → green → verify-green → refactor, the baseline rule (baseline-first, never git stash), the rationalization table, and red flags. Discipline only — test infra and browser toolkits live in test-automation, case derivation in scenario.

# TDD — Red-Green Discipline

## Iron Law

**NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.**

A test written after the code proves the code does what the code does. A test that failed first proves the code fixed a real symptom — the source data shows 24 + 23 + 15 tests all written post-hoc, and separately a wrong root cause shipping through 3 merged PRs that a red test would have caught at step one.

## The Loop

1. **RED** — write the smallest test reproducing the **exact production symptom** (not a paraphrase of it).
2. **VERIFY RED** — run it; **paste the failure output**. A test you never saw fail proves nothing — it may be testing nothing, or testing the wrong thing. The failure must be for the *expected reason*, not an import error.
3. **GREEN** — write the minimum production code to pass. Resist fixing adjacent things.
4. **VERIFY GREEN** — run the test (pass) + the full sweep; paste output. Confirm the pre-existing failure set is unchanged.
5. **REFACTOR** — only now, with the test as the safety net.

## Baseline rule (non-negotiable)

**Baseline-first: run the suite on the untouched tree BEFORE the first edit**, and record the failure set in `plans/<plan>/STATE.md` as `baseline: <X/Y> (<sha7>)`. Step 4 diffs against that line, so regressions stay distinguishable from inherited breakage. Taking the baseline first costs one suite run you were going to pay for anyway and needs no isolation machinery.

**Already dirty when you realize you need one?** Park the WIP on a scratch branch — four steps, none of them optional:

1. `node .claude/hooks/file-claims.cjs list` — **any `FOREIGN` dirty file and you stop here.** Parking another live session's work commits it onto your branch and then strips it from their working tree at checkout. Take the baseline from CI, or wait.
2. `git switch -c wip/<slug>`, then stage your dirty paths **explicitly, untracked ones included** (`git status --porcelain -uall` → `git add <path> …`), then `git commit -m wip`. Never `-A`, never `-am` — see `[[git]]` § Scoped Commits.
3. `git checkout <base-sha>`, then **assert `git status --porcelain` prints nothing.** Non-empty means something did not get parked and the "baseline" is not the base — the exact failure that makes `git stash` unusable. Do not run the suite until it is empty.
4. Run the suite, record the line, `git switch -` back.

Slower, but every step is reversible and visible in `git reflog`.

**A red baseline is a stop, not a note.** If the untouched tree's suite fails where the project expects green, halt **before the first edit** and report it — `baseline: <X/Y> (<sha7>) — BLOCKED: base is red`. Building on unproven ground is how your change inherits someone else's failure. Continue only on an explicit ruling that the failures are known and accepted, and record that ruling on the same line. Same for a runner that cannot run at all (missing dep, dangling venv symlink): prove the runner runs before you trust any count.

**Never `git stash`.** A stash-based baseline **silently no-ops** (dirty state that doesn't stash cleanly, untracked files, partial staging) and there is no error when it happens — a real one produced a commit message that had to be corrected. The failure mode is invisible, so the prohibition must be absolute. Step 3's `git status --porcelain` check is what makes the fallback above immune to the same class: it converts a silent wrong baseline into a stop.

## Rationalization table

| The thought | The reality |
|---|---|
| "It's a one-line fix, a test is overkill" | One-line fixes have the highest wrong-root-cause rate — the test is how you find out the line is wrong |
| "I'll write the test after, while it's fresh" | A post-hoc test asserts the implementation, not the requirement; it passes by construction |
| "The test is hard to write, the fix is obvious" | Hard-to-test = the symptom isn't understood yet; writing the test *is* the diagnosis |
| "The suite is slow, I'll just run the new test" | Step 4 requires the sweep — a green target test with a new red elsewhere is a regression you shipped |
| "This test looks wrong, I'll fix it to pass" | Never weaken or skip assertions to get green; if a test looks wrong, **explain why before changing it** |

## Red flags — stop and restart the loop

- Production code changed before any test ran red.
- A test that passed on first run (you never verified red).
- Assertions deleted/loosened during GREEN.
- "Fixed" claimed from the target test alone, without the sweep.
- Baseline taken via `git stash`, or reconstructed *after* editing began (see above).
- Baseline run at a base checkout whose `git status --porcelain` was not empty — that is not the base.
- Suite "passes" but could not actually run (dangling venv symlink, missing dep) — prove the runner runs first; **never conclude from a suite that could not run**.

## Scope boundary (registry-clean)

- `tdd` (this skill) = the **discipline** — when tests are written and what order.
- `[[test-automation]]` = test **infrastructure and toolkit** — runners, browser/E2E, CI wiring, coverage, load.
- `[[scenario]]` = **case derivation** — which cases exist (happy/negative/recovery).

## Cross-links

`[[scenario]]`, `[[test-automation]]`, `[[debugging]]`, `[[cook]]` (Test stage), `[[run-state]]` (gate lines, baseline line), `[[git]]` (Scoped Commits — the staging rules the dirty-tree fallback obeys)
